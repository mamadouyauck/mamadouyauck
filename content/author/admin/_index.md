I am an assistant professor of statistics in the Department of mathematics at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM).

My current research interests include statistical modeling, social networks, computational statistics, algorithms, causal inference and capture-recapture methods. I am particularly interested in the development of theoretical, methodological, and computational tools for the analysis of link-racing sampling data.

I have developed a network of collaborators in public health, epidemiology, road traffic safety, marketing, and sociology.
