# The 'six degrees separation' theory

--

- The theory states that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps
away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world.

- 'Small world' phenomenon

# (Social) Network Analysis

--

- (Social or Statistical) Network analysis (SNA) is a fairly recent area of research in statistics: at the crossroad of graph theory, computer science, sociology, etc. The roots of sNA is (usually) credited to [Jacob Moreno (1930)](http://www.uky.edu/~rremer/sociometry/Sociometry.pdf).

--

- SNA can be defined as a set of methods that help explore and analyse network data (e.g. people, genes, countries, etc.).

#Terminology & Notation

#Terminology

--

The foundation of network analysis is the graph. Graphs are made up of two sets: a set of nodes/actors/vertices and a set of connections/links/ties/edges between those nodes.

--

**Definition:** A graph is a structure $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices or nodes, and $E$ is the set of edges, links or social ties.

--

- The number of vertices/nodes, $|V|$, is known as the order of the graph $G$, while the number of edges, $|E|$ is the size of the graph.

--

- An edge is represented by a pair of distincts vertices $u, v \in V$ and is denoted $\{u, v\} \in E$.

--

- (Network) Edges can be ${\bf directed}$ or ${\bf undirected}$. If an edge represented by $u \in V$ and $v \in V$ is directed, then $\{u, v\} \in E$ and $\{v, u\} \in E$.

#Notation

--

Network data can be represented in a number of different ways in practice. 

--

**Example:** Consider the network formed by Ousmane (O), Sophie (S), Arame (A), Doudou (D) and Khadim (K). O declares friendship with D; D declares friendship with O; A declares friendship with O, D and K; K declares friendship with O and A; S declares friendship with K.

--

- We can give a list of paired node names that represent edges which define the network: $\{O, D\}$, $\{D, O\}$, $\{A, O\}$, $\{A, D\}$, $\{A, K\}$, $\{K, O\}$, $\{K, A\}$, $\{S, K\}$.



--

- Or we can give a list of the node names $V=\{O, S, A, D, K\}$ and a square binary matrix (often known as a sociomatrix or adjacency matrix). Let ${\bf X}=(X_{ij})_{i,j}$ be a matrix of social ties such that $X_{ij}=1$ if an edge from the $ith$ to the $jth$ node is present, $X_{ij}=0$ otherwise, and $\mbox{diag}({\bf X})={\bf 0}$. In our example, the $5 \times 5$ sociomatrix is:

$$
{\bf X}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.

#Network summarization

#Network-level summaries

--

**Definition:** The density of a graph is the ratio of its observed number of edges to its theoretical maximum. The density of a directed graph $G$ of sociomatrix $\bf X$ is:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}(G)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n X_{ij}}{n\times(n-1)}.
\end{equation}
$$

--

**Definition:** In a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, a tie between vertices $u, v \in V$ is reciprocated if $\{u, v\} \in E$ and $\{v, u\} \in E$. The proportion of times a tie is reciprocated in $G$ or its reciprocity is:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}(G)=\frac{\sum_{i\neq j, i<j}1[X_{ij}=X{ji}]}{\sum_{i\neq j, i<j}1[X_{ij}+X{ji}>0]}.
\end{equation}
$$

--

**Definition:** A clique is a sub-group of nodes in the graph that are maximally connected (e.g. a subgraph of density 1).

--

**Definition:** A community is a sub-group of nodes that are strongly connected (or cohesive) within but only weakly connected outside of the sub-group. 

$\it{Modularity}$ is one metric of covariate/grouping-based clustering.This metric ranges between -0.5 and 1, with larger values meaning stronger clustering.

---

#Node-level summaries

--

**Definition:** The $\it{degree}$ of a node is the number of edges connected to that node.

--

For an undirected graph, the degree of a node $i$ is:

$$
\begin{equation}
d_i=\sum_{j=1}^n X_{ij}.
\end{equation}
$$

--

For a directed graph, we define $\it{in-degree}$ and $\it{out-degree}$ as follows.

--

**Definition:** The $\it{in-degree}$ of a node is the number of edges leading into that node.

$$
\begin{equation}
d_i^{in}=\sum_{j=1}^n X_{ji}.
\end{equation}
$$

**Definition:** The $\it{out-degree}$ of a node is the number of edges originating from that node.

$$
\begin{equation}
d_i^{out}=\sum_{j=1}^n X_{ij}.
\end{equation}
$$
---

#Edge-level summaries

--

**Definition:** A $\it{bridge}$ (or articulation point) is an edge that when removed will increase the number of connected components in the graph.

--

**Definition:** $\it{Homophily}$ is the tendency for nodes with similar attributes to share ties.

--

The metric for homophily is the $\it{assortativity}$ coefficient of Newman:

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sum_{i}f_{ii}-\sum_i f_{i.}f_{.i}}{1-\sum_i f_{i.}f_{.i}},
\end{equation}
$$
where $f_{ij}$ is the fraction of edges linking a node of category $i$ to a node of category $j$, $f_{i.}$ is the fraction of edges originating from a node of category $i$, $f_{.i}$ is the fraction of edges terminating in a node of category $i$. This measure ranges from $-1$ (heterophily) to $1$ (homophily).
