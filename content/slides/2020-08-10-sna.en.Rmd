# The 'six degrees separation' theory

--

- The theory states that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps
away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world.

- 'Small world' phenomenon

# (Social) Network Analysis

--

- Network analysis is a fairly recent area of research in statistics, combining ideas from graph theory
in mathematics, computer science and research from other fields like anthropology, sociology and psychology. The
beginnings of social network analysis is usually credited to Jacob Moreno in the 1930s.

--

- Network analysis, often referred to as statistical network analysis or social network analysis, is a set of methods that
help explore and analyse network data, be those networks of people, networks of countries, networks of genes or any
other kind.

1. statistical modeling of networks

- We choose to use the `R` (statistical software) language to implement the topics introduced in the course because of the flexibility of the language, the excellent visualizations possible and the host of methods for which there are already implemented in R packages.

#Terminology & Notation

#Terminology

--

The foundation of network analysis is the graph. Graphs are made up of two sets: a set of nodes/actors/vertices and a set of connections/links/ties/edges between those nodes.

--

**Definition:** A graph is a structure $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices or nodes, and $E$ is the set of edges, links or social ties.

--

- The number of vertices/nodes, $|V|$, is known as the order of the graph $G$, while the number of edges, $|E|$ is the size of the graph.

--

- An edge is represented by a pair of distincts vertices $u, v \in V$ and is denoted $\{u, v\} \in E$.

--

- (Network) Edges can be ${\bf directed}$ or ${\bf undirected}$. If an edge represented by $u \in V$ and $v \in V$ is directed, then $\{u, v\} \in E$ and $\{v, u\} \in E$.

#Notation

--

Network data can be represented in a number of different ways in practice. 

--

**Example:** Consider the network formed by Ousmane (O), Sophie (S), Arame (A), Doudou (D) and Khadim (K). O declares friendship with D; D declares friendship with O; A declares friendship with O, D and K; K declares friendship with O and A; S declares friendship with K.

--

- We can give a list of paired node names that represent edges which define the network: $\{O, D\}$, $\{D, O\}$, $\{A, O\}$, $\{A, D\}$, $\{A, K\}$, $\{K, O\}$, $\{K, A\}$, $\{S, K\}$.



--

- Or we can give a list of the node names $V=\{O, S, A, D, K\}$ and a square binary matrix (often known as a sociomatrix or adjacency matrix). Let ${\bf X}=(X_{ij})_{i,j}$ be a matrix of social ties such that $X_{ij}=1$ if an edge from the $ith$ to the $jth$ node is present, $X_{ij}=0$ otherwise, and $\mbox{diag}({\bf X})={\bf 0}$. In our example, the $5 \times 5$ sociomatrix is:

$$
{\bf X}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
