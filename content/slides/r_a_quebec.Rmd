#Create a GitHub repository

--

1. Open your [GitHub](https://github.com) account and create a new repository (initialize with a `README` but don't add `.gitignore` for now).

--

1. Go to the main page of the repository, and under the repository name, click the **Clone or download** button.

--

1. In the **Clone with HTTPs** section, click on the clipboard icon to copy the clone URL for the new repository (we will paste this text into the terminal in the next section.) 

---

#Command line/Terminal

# Clone the GitHub repository

We are going to create a local copy of the repository on your computer so you can make the two locations communicate (using the command line tool for Windows or the Terminal for Mac OS X).
--
    
1. Use `cd` to indicate the directory where you want your repository to be located

--

1. Type: `git clone [paste]`.

--

1. Close the command line/terminal.
